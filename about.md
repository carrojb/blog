<h2>Welcome to my little blog!</h2>
I never thought I would be a rancher, even though my grandfather was, as was his, and his father before him, for seven generations my family has had cattle on the same place.
But after two-plus decades of practicing architecture and environmental planning, at the age of 54, I retired and bought my family's farm in Alabama. Truth is its what I always wanted to do.
<p> 
     Cows for me started in high school FFA and where I spent two years working at a local stockyard in Abbeville, Alabama. Monday thru Friday, I watered, fed animals, and helped the vet age and treat sale animals. Friday was sale day; for 24 hours, we sorted and loaded hundreds of cattle and hogs. 
Saturday morning, after working all night I had a big check to carry my girlfriend out on a Saturday night. Mr. Benny Lisenby always slipped a fifty dollar bill in my pocket and told me to buy her a good steak.
  <p>Raising cattle requires long days working in solitude. In all honesty, I work harder now than when I worked a so called real job. Instead of mediating disputes between those seeking preservation, and mining, energy and real estate interests, I listen to silence as I work fences and check cows and watch thunderstorms roll in from the Gulf of Mexico. 
      <p>
With my photography I use natural light, little or no editing, minimalist workflow from the cab of my truck: one camera, a <a href="https://fujifilm-x.com/en-us/x-pro3/"> Fuji X Pro-3</a>, and three fixed lenses, the 16mm, 35mm, and 50mm. I make no effort to market myself, just word of mouth or if you stumble upon this site or Instagram.

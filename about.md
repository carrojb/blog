<h2>Welcome to my little blog!</h2>
I never thought I would grow up to be a rancher, even though my grandfather was, as was his, and his father before him. For seven generations my family has had cattle on the same place.
After two-plus decades of practicing architecture and environmental planning, at the age of 54, I retired and bought my family's farm in Alabama.
<p> 
     Cows for me started in high school where I spent two years in high school working at the local stockyard in Abbeville. Monday thru Friday, I watered, fed animals, and helped the vet age and treat sale animals. Friday was sale day; for 24 hours, we sorted and loaded cattle and pigs. 
Saturday morning, after working all night, we had the animals loaded, and I had a big fat check to carry my girlfriend out on a Saturday night. Mr. Benny Lisenby always slipped a fifty dollar bill in my pocket and told me to buy her steak.
  <p>Raising cattle requires long days and weeks working in solitude. In all honesty, I work harder now than when I worked a real job. Instead of a computer screen and mediating disputes between those developing landscape and seeking preservation, I listen to silence as I work fences and check cows and thunderstorms roll in from the Gulf of Mexico. 
      <p>
With my photography I use natural light, little or no editing, minimalist workflow from the cab of my truck: one camera, a <a href="https://fujifilm-x.com/en-us/x-pro3/"> Fuji X Pro-3</a>, and three fixed lenses, the 16mm, 35mm, and 50mm. I make no effort to market myself, just word of mouth or if you stumble upon this site or Instagram.

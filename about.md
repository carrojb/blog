**Jon Kalev** (born 1966) 
Hi welcome to my little web site! I'm a landscape architect and planner. Since retiring in 2019 Kalev I have  been using my camera and drawings to document the rural landscapes. 
I am espcially interested in the resultant urban form of racially segregated landscapes.


This website is an archive of my photography and drawings. It is a work in progress. Pages will be updated and new ones will be added continuously. In the main column under the "blog" ink you find my ongoing journal. 

In the pages under "Works" you find samples of old and new works, short descriptions, and installation photographs. Books, Prints, etc are listed under "Shop".
Please contact me by email with any questions or comments about this website and its contents, or if you wish to publish, exhibit, or purchase any of my works. For the purchase of books and editions please visit my "Shop".

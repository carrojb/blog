<h2>Hi welcome to my little blog!</h2>
I'm a landscape architect and planner, since retiring from practice I use my camera, sketches, and drawings documenting place.  
Examining the "vernacular landscape", I'm interested in the resultant urban form and how it creates cultural identity from collective trauma.
Beyond the common myth that landscape is shaped by market forces or designers manipulating physical environment, I argue space is increasingly mediated by advertising, access to technology, and influences of immigration.

Such cultural landscapes are deeply informed by contradictions to the historic narrative. Lynching trees, churches burned by the Klan but repeatedly rebuilt in the same place serves as unseen anchors to community identity uniqie to a specific landscape.
Documentary photography captures these identities momentarily revealing the complexity.   


This website is an archive of my photography and drawings. It is a work in progress. Pages will be updated and new ones will be added continuously. In the menu under the "blog" ink you find my ongoing journal and unedited thoughts along with a few photographs. 

In the pages under "Projects" you find samples of old and new works, short descriptions, and installation photographs. Books, Prints, etc are listed under "Shop".

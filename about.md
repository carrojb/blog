<h2>Hi welcome to my little blog!</h2>
I never thought I would grow up to be a rancher, even though my grandfather was, as was his, and his father before him.
After two-plus decades of practicing architecture and planning, at the age of 54, I retired and bought my family's farm and a farm on Cowpen Creek in Coffee County, Alabama.<p> Maybe it's in my blood, as they say, a fate unavoidable. I spent two years in high school working at the local stockyard in Abbeville. Monday thru Friday, I watered, fed animals, and helped the vet age and treat sale animals. Friday was sale day; for 24 hours, we sorted and loaded cattle and pigs. 
Saturday morning, after working all night, we had all the animals loaded, and I had a big fat check to carry my girlfriend out on a Saturday night.
  <p>Raising cattle requires long days and weeks, at times working in solitude. In all honesty, I work harder now than when I worked a real job. Instead of a computer screen and mediating disputes between those developing landscape and seeking preservation, I listen to silence as I work fences and check cows and thunderstorms roll in from the Gulf of Mexico. Make no mistake, it is hard physical work, but it connects you deeply to the land, in that connection is a beauty.
My choice to pick up a camera came after taking a year's sabbatical working as an alpine guide in the San Juan Mountains of Colorado. My formal training as an architect and landscape architect did not prepare me for understanding the avalanche risk of a snowpack, knowing what trails went where and how to deal with bears, but it was infinitely more rewarding. After this experience, I could never go back to my day job. I tried serving as a director of planning in Wyoming, but the truth is I wanted to be outdoors every tick of the clock. 
    <p>In the process of recovery from the "real world," I saw what can be described as a place formed of geology and geography as opposed to the traditional view of man imposing his will upon a landscapeâ€”forests less a scenic experience and more a host organism. The best way I found to explore these experiences is with my camera.
There is something about working alone in a manner where it is just daylight or dark, no days or deadlines, no need to know what week it is: just the season, the cycle of a herd calving, confronting life and death.
I work alone, natural light, little or no editing, minimalist approach usually from the cab of my truck: one camera, a Fuji X pro-3, and three fixed lenses, the 16, 35, and 50. I make no effort to market myself, just word of mouth or if you stumble upon this site or Instagram account.

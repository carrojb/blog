It's been a while since I have posted to my little blog that reflects serious thought and with good reason. 
Life has a way of sweeping you away with its current and no time left for reflection; all you can do is hold on.

I describe this with the analogy of canoeing when you enter the rapids for a short stretch. Your attention is reduced to just keeping the boat upright. The surrounding landscape, the destination, even knowing what day it is, is not part of your awareness at the moment. Hyper-attentive states like this are a protective response to what we perceive. We all have them, and the fight or flight behavior adapted from 300,000 years of being chased by wolves and being eaten by lions. 
The answer is to develop deep awareness or what some psychologists and some traditions of meditation call mindfulness.
How do you remain non-judgmental in the sense that there is no sense-making of what is happening or perceived risk from what is overwhelming you?
The short answer is a soulmate.
Don Freedman, an old friend of mine shared he once had a experience with the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (OSHO) in India that changed how he viewed relationships. He described life with a soulmate is best described as "surfing."
Understand when I first heard this, we were walking across a 10,000 ft mesa arm-in-arm with closed eyes after identifying a point way into the mountains in front of us then waking in that direction—imagining a tree on a forested slope miles away. 
He was living in Telluride during ski season and had experienced a stroke, and often we would take long walks with his wife across the mesa arm-in-arm. She had worked as a ski instructor, had experienced an accident, and had burn scars on her body but was a stunning woman who he described as the key ingredient in what made things work in his life. He said what the Bhagwan had advised him to do was to think about life and your relationships with the mindset of a surfer. 
“Be a surfer”, he said.

You get on your board and paddle out to sea. Immediately you are overwhelmed by the experience of something so vast and powerful and is unfathomably deep. It's easy to let the fear of the unknown overwhelm you. At times you want to head back to shore; every thought you have tells you this is risky. These are the demons developed from eons of being prey.
But if you detach yourself from thinking and wonder at the vastness and feel the sea's power, it is a direct experience of the universe and the divine.
You are not just experiencing the power of the universe,  you are an active part of it, working with it, not against it.
It is a humbling and magical experience.
"My wife, and best friend" he smiled and said, "is my surfboard. Without her, I would never get to experience the sea (life). I would be like those on the shore, just looking at people surf and endlessly talking about surfing. The experience would remain an idea, not a actuallized experience".
At times, there will be waves that you joyously ride, and then times of no waves. Even when surfing a wave, there will be crests and troughs (ups and downs), and even when it's totally calm, in these quiet moments you will be  struck again by a power so vast and infinite you are made small.
Fact is most men think of a woman as an object and our culture relentlessly reinforces this belief system. Their outward beauty is something to comment on celebrate and evaluate them by, but the surfer ….is always aware of the inner beauty of what they are and their role in his life. 
This makes the physical surface of a woman at any given point in the aging process, be it youth or elderly, seem small.
Here is what I have learned from Mr Freedman, if you focus on the deeper meaning of what a partner is and allow yourself to get lost in the sea (of life), you will be where God wants you to be and have a contagious feeling of gratefulness that will overflow into all those around you.
This is how the Bhagwan (OSHO) said a relationship between two souls is the greatest.
Your partner is the surfboard that puts you in the sea of life. Together you make magic because without her, there is no sea.
Be grateful and do not attach yourself to past experiences or future expectations.
Surf.

title: Drilling a well
---

I decided to have a well drilled. Many reasons, one I want this ranch to be totally self reliant, that means no dependent connection to county water, same with utilities, I want a solar system so connection to the grid and reliance on anything or anybody optional. Secondly I my cattle to have drinking clean water and not drinking from the ponds they urinate and defecate in. Several recent studies confirmed this , Hay and Forage published an article last year writing “Water quality impacts the palatability of water and can also cause cattle to drink less. This leads to reduced feed consumption and less weight gained.” and in a  Noble News and Views article, Caitlin Hebbert wrote where they found “cattle that have access to clean, aerated water spend more time grazing and less time resting than those drinking from farm ponds.“ The Noble Institute cited a study conducted in Saskatchewan that identified a 9-10% increase in weight gain of steers and calves drinking from water pumped into a trough versus those that drank from a pond. Similar studies have observed as high as a 16% increase in gains for stocker steers with access to clean water.” 
Bottom line, clean water equals healthier cattle.

"Welcome to the world," I said to this little calf in a cold rain after she was born, struggling to her feet, mother licking her, and nursing.
Named "Hope," she's a culmination of two years of work to produce a black F1 hybrid / Bahama Angus cross. The type of cow that I think best adapted to my ranch. Parallel to that, I embarked on keeping a journal of restoring a farm in rural Alabama.
The ear tag number (101) signifies a new beginning after what feels like a hundred years of darkness.

For four decades, at multiple times, I attempted to raise cattle on my family's land. Every time my father blocked it, who's excuses - mainly it interfered with his hunting, he didn't think cows would eat the grass we had, he wanted his cousin to farm it. The excuses never ended. My mother believed the real reason behind this was he didn't like the farm to be productive why I have no clue; none of it to this day makes any sense why one would purposely harm a family farm to prevent others from using it.
He tried everything he could to block me, which included trying to force my mother's caregivers to cut fences and letting cows out. He openly would speak of this and could care less if anyone heard him. People tell me, "oh, that's just Byron; he's mean as hell." This culminated when he attempted to force my mother to deed the property to his Mormon family members.
<p>
 When my mother was in rehab after her stroke she said somethign to me on her borthday I will never forget. My father didnt show up that day at the hopsital instead he went to a restauarant where he gave a waitress a hundred dollar tip and flirted with ehr. My mother and I sat alone in her hospital room eating the cake I got her. She said. "I want you to always remember its just you and me".

It is heartbreaking how my mother suffered. She was the one who had most of her life taken from her. Her parents loaned them the money to buy the farm and build a house that my father never repaid. He decided for her what the tv was tuned to, and he would control what she ate. He spent eyars harasing her trying make her retire from teaching so she could be told by him what to do everyday.
I want to clear the air in this little community. Byron was kicked to the curb for a good reason; remember this.
The reality is my father long-abused my mother and me. I've been beaten by this man with sticks, fists, and belts.
Not once in my life is a memory of him shaking my hand, patting me on the back, or even inquiring about college or degrees I received, much less giving a compliment. 
This speaks directly to who and what he is.
As a child and then teenager, I reached out for help to my grandparents, to counselors at Abbeville high school, and to so-called religious Mormons in my family.

Most damaging is how he treated my mother, which as a helpless stroke victim, is disgusting. Judge Derrick Peterson is the first person ever to hold him accountable by issuing a protective order for my mother. Even Derrick was compromised when lied to in a hearing neither my mother nor I was notified of when told that I had agreed to him living in a cabin I owned on our farm. Which, when I finally got a hearing in court, those who misled the judge were called out and the record set straight.
<p>
If you want to understand who Byron Carroll really is, know when my mother had a stroke, he watched and didn't say a word and put her in a bed. He went back to watching what he described as "an important ball game." The next morning he called, and my then-girlfriend at the time, Teresa Crozier, and I came to their house where she was in her bed fully clothed, unable to speak or move, face down drooling where he had left her the night before.
I think she had a stroke; he pointed at her and said.
We called 911 and rushed her to meet the ambulance coming from Abbeville, some 20 miles away. Teresa, to her credit, warned me he would harm my mother or me one day.
<p>
In the only moment of remorse he's ever made that I have witnessed, he said, "I reckon I should have called an ambulance, but there was a big ball game on." 
So he left my mother in a bed after having a stroke for 12 fucking hours….to watch ball games.
Then consider that he literally ripped depend undergarments off of her and said he can't afford for her to have these while stuffing a soiled bath cloth in her pants.
Meanwhile, I discovered he was going through a bank drive-through, withdrawing thousands weekly and paying a driver to carry him to a local restaurant in Ozark daily to flirt with waitresses.
The $1,200 plus he spent weekly going to a restaurant chasing waitresses with a box of condoms in his truck and attempting to buy viagra tells you exactly why he is no longer welcome in our lives.
My mother didn't deserve to be treated this way.
This story does not get better when you consider the list of former caregivers hired to care for my mother that came to her allege he sexually assaulted them, providing the court and DHR affidavits and reporting to law enforcement. 
<p>
When a woman has been married for 64 years, and her concern is, she believes he will kill himself and us if he gets the chance, we should listen. "Please never let him come back here," she repeated to counselors and DHR social workers. And emphatically plea she does not want to be buried in the same cemetery that her husband is and you are her son then the decision is simple.
  <p>
Protect her.
<p>
The moral question remains do you forgive a person like my father, which in reality means you let him come on the family farm and fish and hunt as he has done on this land since he was a child?
This gives him what he wants use of our family land with no concern to those he's harmed. A year after he was removed, not once has he inquired or done anything to support my mother. 
That burden has fallen on me.
  <p>
Before I wrote what I am thinking, I want to explain. I am a believer in a higher power call it divine call it God. I am not a churchgoer; at best, I wander into a synagogue once or twice a year and worship as part of a community. And my task of keeping a journal, I wondered if this was too personal, but then I was reminded that is what a journal is.
<p>
Instead of church or synagogue, I try to believe and live my faith simply. In that, I fail miserably daily. But being a man of faith, scriptures have meaning. 
The Bible tells us, "You shall not hate your brother in your heart" (Leviticus 19:17)
The best example is the story of Joseph and his brothers.
In Rabbi Luzzatto's classic Mesillas Yesharim [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesillat_Yesharim ] I found this discussion,
"Hate and revenge, too, are very difficult for man's spiteful heart to escape, for in view of his being extremely sensitive to insult and suffering great anguish because of it, revenge, which is the only thing which will put him at rest, is sweeter than honey to him" (Chapter 11). 
Psychologically there is positive energy when someone wants something from us, and we are able to say no. I remember what you did to me. But that doesn't make it the right moral decision.
  <p>
The Torah says, "Lo sikom — You shall not take revenge" (Leviticus 19:18).
Rabbi Luzzato writes,
    <p><i>
So, you forgo "the only thing which will put [you] to rest" and which "is sweeter than honey," and you want to say, "You don't deserve favor from me. But I am more of a mentsch [decent person] than you are, and I will do it for you." But the Torah states, "Lo sitor — You shall not bear a grudge" (ibid.). If you are able to do the favor, you should do it without comment"</i>.
<p>
But how do you find a forgiving heart in such circumstances?
<p>
I kept going back to Joseph's story and found something I had missed. After Jacob died, the brothers sent a message to him that Jacob had asked him to forgive them. Joseph said to them, "Fear not, for am I instead of God? Although you intended me harm, God intended it for good" (Genesis 50:16-20).
<p>
There is the key concept I missed in the first reading when bad things happen and a person is purposely harmed; God may be using this for a greater good we don't realize.
This point I have written on my hand occasionally to make me remember the point, what we perceive as harm by another, in fact, could be something God intends for good.
<p>
One of my favorite guides to understanding scripture at depth is the writings of a medieval Jewish Rabbi named Shlomo Yitzchaki, commonly referred to as Rashi. [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashi ] In his commentary on the Torah and this story of Joseph and his brothers, he explains that Joseph said that "there is no point in fearing that he would exact revenge because man cannot control the outcome of his actions. If I would wish to punish you, I am powerless to do so, because Hashem (God) determines the results of one's actions." 
If we realize we are powerless to take revenge, it is easier to ignore that desire.
Having subdued your drive for what "is sweeter than honey" and given up "the only thing which will put [you] to rest," you find that you still feel hostility toward the offender. 
  <p>
Rashi's words are intriguing because contrary to Christians who are admonished to forgive, he adds another level of thought by observing how God uses these to stop things that harm others for a greater good.
This enabled me to realize that what happened to my mother and me could be how God was handling larger issues, and our only course is to forgive those who harmed us and trust God has a purpose in these events. 
If Rashi and the Torah are right, God will never ask us what we cannot do. Each test he gives us of being able to hold on to our anger and not take revenge is an act of forgiving in its way.
    <p>
There is another psychological energy being built up here that psychologists do not describe, but one Rashi is zoned in on, and Joseph clearly understood.
As I watched my father approach me that day, I realized a point what he would do. When in court, I said candidly I thought of shooting him to stop it, but I didn't want to be the guy that killed his father; instead, he ran over me, and that led to a series of events that neither his lies nor his lawyer could overcome. His actions and my inaction of not seeking revenge defeated all his plans.
This is how God works, and I have learned thanks to Rashi and Joseph.
To be clear are under no obligation to take him back into our family. But we do not hold a grudge, and we can forgive him. 
And it is a reminder through his malicious actions, and God used to protect us.

This is my friend Buck Turner, recently retired logger. He has spent most of his 80 plus years in the woods of south Alabama. 
<p><i>“ I got lured into leaving once, a big city job ruined my mind. I spent about a week there then skedaddled right back home.”
There is something about the woods these big pine forests and swamps. Once you stay in em a while they're home and keep calling you back”.</i>
  
Buck is 86 and still kicking a daylight to dark worker.
